# AI-Based Traffic Management System

## 🚦 Project Overview
The **AI-Based Traffic Management System** leverages image processing and artificial intelligence to optimize traffic signals and suggest efficient paths based on real-time traffic conditions. This project aims to reduce traffic congestion, minimize waiting times at intersections, and provide an optimized route for vehicles.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Image Processing:** Uses cameras to capture real-time traffic data and analyze the number of vehicles on each road.
- **Traffic Signal Optimization:** Dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on traffic density.
- **Optimized Path Suggestion:** Utilizes **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to recommend the fastest routes by analyzing traffic weights at each intersection.
- **Lane-Specific Control:** Manages traffic lights separately for each lane at an intersection to enhance traffic flow.
- **Scalability:** Designed to be scalable for managing multiple intersections simultaneously.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++ for core logic and algorithms.
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV or TensorFlow for real-time vehicle detection and counting.
- **Algorithms:** **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for path optimization and priority queues for signal management.
- **AI Models:** YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection.

## 📊 System Architecture
1. **Traffic Data Collection:** Cameras capture live traffic feeds at each intersection.
2. **Image Processing:** 
   - Detects the number of vehicles per lane using a pre-trained YOLO model.
   - Assigns weights to each road based on vehicle count.
3. **Signal Optimization:** 
   - Dynamically adjusts traffic light durations based on traffic density.
   - Manages signals individually for each lane at an intersection.
4. **Path Optimization:**
   - Uses **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to suggest the shortest and least congested paths based on real-time traffic data.

## 🔄 How It Works
1. **Capture traffic data** using image processing.
2. **Analyze vehicle density** to assign weights to roads.
3. **Adjust traffic lights** based on real-time traffic using priority queues.
4. **Suggest optimized paths** using **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for shortest pathfinding.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integration of **machine learning** for better traffic prediction.
- Support for **emergency vehicle prioritization**.
- Mobile application for **live traffic updates** and optimized path suggestions.
