🚦 Smart Traffic Management System

📍 Overview

The Smart Traffic Management System is a web-based application designed to help reduce traffic congestion by providing users with real-time, optimized route suggestions based on current traffic conditions. By integrating Google Maps APIs and intelligent route analysis, the system aims to improve travel efficiency, reduce waiting times, and assist in smart urban mobility.

🌟 Key Features
	•	🔍 Smart ETA: Displays both normal and traffic-adjusted Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).
	•	🗺️ Interactive Map: Embedded Google Maps to visualize real-time routes and traffic conditions.
	•	🚗 Live Route Suggestions: Suggests optimal routes using traffic-aware data from Google Directions API.
	•	📱 Responsive Design: Works smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
	•	⚙️ Modular Architecture: Easily extendable for future features like heatmaps or traffic signal simulation.

🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, EJS
	•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js
	•	APIs: Google Maps JavaScript API, Google Directions API
	•	HTTP Client: Axios

🧠 How It Works
	1.	User inputs origin and destination.
	2.	The system fetches route and ETA data from the Google Directions API.
	3.	Both Normal ETA and Smart ETA (adjusted for traffic) are displayed.
	4.	The map updates visually to reflect the current best route.

📈 Future Enhancements
	•	🚨 Traffic incident alerts and user reporting
	•	🌐 Real-time traffic heatmaps
	•	🚦 Smart traffic signal simulation
	•	🚑 Emergency vehicle route prioritization
